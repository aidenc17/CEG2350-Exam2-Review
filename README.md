## Questions on `grep`, `sed` and `awk` are here to get you comfortable before the exam.
**Feel free to use past notes or `man` pages on your terminal!!**

**Use the `employees.csv` file located in this repo for the next questions.**


### `grep` Questions:
1. Find all employees in the "Engineering" department.
2. Display lines containing "HR" employees.
3. Find employees whose name contains "John".
4. Show lines with a salary greater than 70000 (you may need to refine this after `grep` using `awk`).

# Disk, Partition, and Filesystem Practice Questions

**Keep in mind I have not been to class with you! These are questions to provoke thought and get the wheels turning!**
**If it does not sound like somehting you covered, you probably haven't!!**

These are all based off my notes when I took the course!

# Disk Storage
1. **What is the primary function of a disk?**  
   - [ ] To process data  
   - [ ] To store and retrieve data  
   - [ ] To transmit network signals  
   - [ ] To execute software instructions  

2. **How does an HDD differ from an SSD in terms of operation?**  
   - [ ] HDDs use magnetic platters, while SSDs use flash memory  
   - [ ] HDDs are faster than SSDs  
   - [ ] SSDs require mechanical movement to access data  
   - [ ] SSDs cannot be used as boot drives  

3. **What command would you use to list all block devices on a Linux system?**  
   - [ ] `lsblk`  
   - [ ] `df -h`  
   - [ ] `du -sh`  
   - [ ] `blkid`  

# MBR (Master Boot Record)
4. **What is the purpose of an MBR?**  
   - [ ] To store user files  
   - [ ] To manage RAM allocation  
   - [ ] To hold partition information and bootloader  
   - [ ] To provide file encryption  

5. **Why is MBR not ideal in terms of corruption?**  
   - [ ] It has no redundancy  
   - [ ] It cannot store bootloaders  
   - [ ] It supports too many partitions  
   - [ ] It only works on SSDs  

6. **How many primary partitions can an MBR disk have?**  
   - [ ] 2  
   - [ ] 4  
   - [ ] 6  
   - [ ] 8

   - [ ] 1 TB  
   - [ ] 2 TB  
   - [ ] 4 TB  
   - [ ] 8 TB  

# GPT (GUID Partition Table)

   - [ ] 2 TB  
   - [ ] 16 TB  
   - [ ] 9.4 ZB  
   - [ ] 128 PB  

9. **How does GPT improve redundancy compared to MBR?**  
   - [ ] It stores multiple copies of the partition table  
   - [ ] It uses more sectors for partitioning  
   - [ ] It has a built-in error correction system  
   - [ ] It does not require a bootloader  

10. **Where is the bootloader stored in a GPT-partitioned system?**  
   - [ ] In the primary partition  
   - [ ] In the EFI System Partition (ESP)  
   - [ ] In the last sector of the disk  
   - [ ] In the master boot record  

11. **How does Windows allow users to view partitions with GPT?**  
   - [ ] Using `diskpart` and Disk Management  
   - [ ] Through the command `lsblk`  
   - [ ] Using BIOS settings

   - [ ] `cat /dev/xvda`  

# Storage & Measurement
23. **How does a file system help organize stored data?**
